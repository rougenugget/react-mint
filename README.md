# react-mint

Another starter app for building with React using Babel, Express, and Webpack.

With lots of help from [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@viatsko/react-for-beginners-part-1-setting-up-repository-babel-express-web-server-webpack-a3a90cc05d1e#.fl3rrpf7f) by [Valerii Iatsko](https://github.com/viatsko) and using [node-sass-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass-middleware), I made react-mint to use as a template for starting simple Node/React projects. As a designer, most other React starter projects I found came with a lot more power than I needed, (or knew what to do with) so I made this one as bare bones as I possibly could.

A few remaining TODOs are:

- [x] Add simple CSS component-based file structure
- [x] Add a very basic CSS reset
- [ ] Add a basic responsive setup

... and other things as I think of them.

Feel free to use as-is, however this is a WIP! You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to get started. I use [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) for CSS changes.

Let me know if you have any tips or suggestions to make this even simpler. :)

Cheers!
