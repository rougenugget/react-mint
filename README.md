# react-mint

Another React starter app using Babel, Express, and Webpack.

With lots of help from [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@viatsko/react-for-beginners-part-1-setting-up-repository-babel-express-web-server-webpack-a3a90cc05d1e#.fl3rrpf7f) by [Valerii Iatsko](https://github.com/viatsko) and using [node-sass-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass-middleware), react-mint is a super simple template to start new Node/React projects with. Being a designer, most other React starter projects I found included a lot power more than I needed or knew what to do with, so I made this one as bare bones as I possibly could.

A few remaining TODOs are:

* [ ] Add BEM style component structure
* [ ] Add a very basic CSS reset
* [ ] Add a basic responsive setup

... and other things as I think of them.

Feel free to use as-is, but this is a WIP! You'll need Node.js and npm to get started.

Let me know if you have any tips or suggestions to make this even simpler. :)

Cheers!
