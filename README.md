# react-mint

An as simple as I could manage React starter app using Babel, Express, and Webpack.


With help from [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@viatsko/react-for-beginners-part-1-setting-up-repository-babel-express-web-server-webpack-a3a90cc05d1e#.fl3rrpf7f) and [node-sass-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass-middleware), I'm making a super simple React app as a template to easily create new projects from. Other React starter projects I found included a lot more than I needed, so like everyone else, I made yet another one. :)

Just starting this out but my remaining TODOs are:

- [] Add BEM style component structure
- [] Add a very basic CSS reset
- [] Add a basic responsive setup

... and other things as I think of them.

Feel free to use as-is, but this is a WIP.

Cheers!
