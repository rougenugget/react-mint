# react-mint

Another React starter app using Babel, Express, and Webpack.

With help from [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@viatsko/react-for-beginners-part-1-setting-up-repository-babel-express-web-server-webpack-a3a90cc05d1e#.fl3rrpf7f) by [Valerii Iatsko](https://github.com/viatsko) and [node-sass-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass-middleware), this is a super simple Node and React app to use as a template to easily create new projects from. Other React starter projects I found included a lot power more than I needed, so I made this one as bare bones as I could.

Just starting this out. Remaining TODOs are:

* [ ] Add BEM style component structure
* [ ] Add a very basic CSS reset
* [ ] Add a basic responsive setup

... and other things as I think of them.

Feel free to use as-is, but this is a WIP. Let me know if you have any tips or suggestions to make this even simpler!

Cheers!
